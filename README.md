Clinical visits that take place in discrete time scale usually introduce missing data problem, while pharmacy dispensations from administrative data are naturally continuous due to the record linkage feature, and can thus avoid such problem. For many longitudinal pharmacoepidemiological studies, treatment episode construction and dealing with time-varying exposure and confounders are the major challenges.  

This repository contains the source code to perform simulation studies with various combinations of the state-of-the-art marginal structural models in discrete and continuous-time and a thorough data cleaning and analysis steps for demonstration. Due to confidentiality reasons, the original data and SAS cleaning code are not presented here, but a full version of thesis and results are available upon request.
